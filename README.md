## 🔐 Login Tests

In this project, we use Cypress to test various login scenarios. The following test cases are included:

- ✅ Successful login with valid email and password.
- 📧 Login attempt with an invalid email.
- ❌ Login attempt with both invalid email and invalid password.
- 📋 Login attempt with valid email and password but without accepting terms.

These tests aim to ensure that the login form functions correctly and user validations are handled appropriately.

Additionally, we have utilized ⚡️ Vite and ⚛️ React for building the application, and 💅 Bootstrap and 🎨 Reactstrap for styling.
